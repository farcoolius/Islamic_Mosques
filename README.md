# Islamic Mosques in Seattle

## Project Overview
This participatory web map visualizes mosque locations across Seattle, Washington. The project highlights the spatial distribution and historical presence of mosques from the 1990s to 2026. It demonstrates how community knowledge can contribute to mapping cultural and religious landscapes.

As someone who identifies as Muslim, this project is personally meaningful to me. Mosques represent more than a religous setting; they are symbols of peace, community, and cultural identity. This map invites users to explore mosque communities across Seattle and contribute locations they also know about.
